# Web Scraping Project

## Description

This is a web scraping project aimed at collecting and analyzing rent prices in Downtown Toronto. The data is scraped from a real estate website to help users find the best apartment deals for the upcoming school year.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests

## Features

- Simulated Human-Like Behavior: Implemented strategies to mimic human behavior, including custom headers, rate limiting, and random request intervals, to avoid detection by anti-DDoS services and ensure ethical scraping.

- Error Handling: Gracefully handled exceptions and errors with logging mechanisms for troubleshooting.

- CSV Export: Organized the scraped data into a structured CSV file for easy access and reusability.

- User-Friendly Interface: Created a user-friendly interface to prompt users for input, enhancing project usability.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/web-scraping-project.git`
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install beautifulsoup4 requests`
3. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Ethical Consideration

Always check the website's Terms of Service and robots.txt file before scraping. Respect website policies and do not overload servers with excessive requests.

## Learning Experience

Throughout this project, I encountered various challenges and learned how to overcome them, which significantly improved my web scraping skills.
